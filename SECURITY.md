# Security Policy

## üîí Security Commitment

Plaesy Spec-Kit takes security seriously and follows constitutional principles that enforce security-first development practices across all projects using our framework.

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

| Version | Security Support | Constitutional Compliance |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Full support | ‚úÖ OWASP Top 10 enforced |
| 0.x.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical only | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic security checks |

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us privately** at: [security@plaesy.dev](mailto:security@plaesy.dev)
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **24 hours** | Initial acknowledgment of your report |
| **72 hours** | Preliminary assessment and severity classification |
| **7 days** | Detailed investigation and fix development |
| **14 days** | Security patch release and public disclosure |

### Security Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Reward |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **üî¥ Critical** | Remote code execution, privilege escalation | 24 hours | $500-2000 |
| **üü† High** | Authentication bypass, data exposure | 72 hours | $200-500 |
| **üü° Medium** | Cross-site scripting, CSRF | 7 days | $50-200 |
| **üü¢ Low** | Information disclosure, minor issues | 14 days | Recognition |

## üîê Security Features

### Constitutional Security Enforcement

The framework automatically enforces these security principles:

#### OWASP Top 10 Compliance (Automatic)

| OWASP Category | Framework Enforcement | Validation |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| **A01: Broken Access Control** | Principle of least privilege patterns | Static analysis + runtime checks |
| **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | AES-256, Argon2/bcrypt mandatory | Dependency scanning + code review |
| **A03: Injection** | Parameterized queries enforced | SQL injection detection tools |
| **A04: Insecure Design** | Security-first architecture patterns | Architecture review automation |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Secure defaults + configuration audit | Automated configuration scanning |
| **A06: Vulnerable Components** | Daily dependency vulnerability scans | Automated dependency updates |
| **A07: Authentication Failures** | MFA support + secure session management | Authentication testing framework |
| **A08: Data Integrity Failures** | Secure serialization patterns | Data validation + integrity checks |
| **A09: Logging Failures** | Security event logging mandatory | Log analysis + anomaly detection |
| **A10: SSRF** | Request allowlist validation | Network security testing |

#### Additional Security Controls

```bash
# Automated security validation (runs on every commit)
plaesy security-scan     # OWASP dependency check
plaesy code-analysis     # Static security analysis  
plaesy config-audit      # Configuration security review
plaesy penetration-test  # Basic automated pen testing
```

### Secure Development Lifecycle

1. **Design Phase**: Threat modeling mandatory
2. **Development Phase**: Security-first TDD principles
3. **Testing Phase**: Security tests in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Deployment Phase**: Security configuration validation
5. **Monitoring Phase**: Runtime security monitoring

## üéØ Security Best Practices for Users

### Project Initialization
```bash
# Always initialize with security-first templates
plaesy init . --security-level high

# Enable all security validations
plaesy config security --strict-mode
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Run security checks before commits
plaesy pre-commit-security-check

# Validate dependencies for known vulnerabilities
plaesy dependency-security-scan

# Review security posture
plaesy security-dashboard
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Final security validation before deployment
plaesy production-security-check

# Generate security compliance report
plaesy security-report --format pdf
```
