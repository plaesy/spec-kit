## Pre-Session Setup _(5 minutes)_

### Ground Rules

- ❌ **No judgment** - Criticism comes later, not during generation

### Materials Ready

## Phase 2: Divergent Thinking _(20-30 minutes)_

### Idea Generation Rules

- Set timer for 5-minute bursts

- [Bad idea 3]

_Now flip these: How could we turn these bad ideas into good ones?_

- [Flipped idea 1]
- [Flipped idea 2]
- [Flipped idea 3]

### Round 4: Build on Others _(5 minutes)_

_Take someone else's idea and extend it_

- [Original idea] → [Extended version]
- [Original idea] → [Extended version]
- [Original idea] → [Extended version]

- [Idea H]
- [Idea I]

### Initial Filtering

_Remove duplicates and obviously unfeasible ideas_

**Removed Ideas** (and why):

- [Idea Y]: [Reason for removal]

### Dot Voting

_Each participant gets 3-5 votes to indicate their favorite ideas_

**Vote Results**:

- [Idea 1]: ●●●●● "5 votes"
- [Idea 2]: ●●●● "4 votes"
- [Idea 3]: ●●● "3 votes"
- [Idea 4]: ●● "2 votes"
- [Idea 5]: ● "1 vote"

## Phase 4: Evaluation _(10-15 minutes)_

### Top Ideas Assessment

_Evaluate the top 3-5 ideas against criteria_

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- **Impact**: How much will this help? (1-5)
- **Feasibility**: How easy to implement? (1-5)
- **Resources**: What resources needed? (1-5, where 1=minimal)
- **Timeline**: How long to implement? (1-5, where 1=quick)

| Idea     | Impact | Feasibility | Resources | Timeline | Total |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | --------- | -------- | ----- |
| [Idea 1] | 5      | 3           | 2         | 4        | 14    |
| [Idea 2] | 4      | 5           | 4         | 5        | 18    |
| [Idea 3] | 3      | 4           | 3         | 3        | 13    |

### Risk Assessment

**For each top idea, what could go wrong?**

**[Top Idea 1]**:

- Risk: [Potential problem]
- Mitigation: [How to address it]

**[Top Idea 2]**:

- Risk: [Potential problem]
- Mitigation: [How to address it]
