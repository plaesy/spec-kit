# Multi-Agent Constitutional Development Framework

## Agent Coordination Configuration

### Primary Agents
- **architect**: System design and constitutional compliance validation
- **developer**: TDD implementation with real dependency testing
- **tester**: Quality assurance and constitutional testing validation
- **security**: OWASP compliance and security review
- **reviewer**: Code review and constitutional standards enforcement

### Agent Interactions
```yaml
workflow:
  - architect: Validates constitutional compliance of designs
  - developer: Implements following TDD principles
  - tester: Validates all constitutional testing requirements
  - security: Reviews for OWASP compliance
  - reviewer: Ensures constitutional standards met
```

## Constitutional Framework Rules (Multi-Agent Enforced)

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **architect**: Designs testable interfaces and contracts
- **developer**: Implements Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly
- **tester**: Validates 90%+ coverage and real dependency usage
- **reviewer**: Verifies TDD process was followed

### Interface Contracts
- **architect**: Defines comprehensive API contracts (OpenAPI)
- **developer**: Implements contract-first development
- **tester**: Validates contract compliance and error handling
- **security**: Reviews contracts for security implications

### Observability
- **architect**: Designs monitoring and logging architecture
- **developer**: Implements structured logging with correlation IDs
- **tester**: Validates observability implementations
- **reviewer**: Ensures monitoring standards are met

### Security by Design
- **architect**: Incorporates security in system design
- **developer**: Implements secure coding practices
- **security**: Performs comprehensive security review
- **tester**: Includes security testing in validation

### Real Dependency Testing
- **architect**: Designs integration testing strategy
- **developer**: Implements tests with actual external systems
- **tester**: Validates no mocks in integration tests
- **reviewer**: Confirms constitutional testing compliance

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Planning Phase
1. **architect** creates system design following constitutional principles
2. **security** reviews design for security implications
3. **tester** defines testing strategy with real dependencies
4. **reviewer** validates constitutional compliance

### Implementation Phase
1. **developer** implements using TDD with constitutional requirements
2. **tester** validates test coverage and real dependency usage
3. **security** reviews code for OWASP compliance
4. **reviewer** ensures constitutional standards are maintained

### Integration Phase
1. **architect** validates system integration follows design
2. **developer** implements integration with real dependencies
3. **tester** performs comprehensive integration testing
4. **security** validates security in integrated system

## Quality Gates (Multi-Agent Validated)

### Code Quality
- **developer**: Implements clean, maintainable code
- **reviewer**: Validates coding standards and patterns
- **tester**: Ensures comprehensive test coverage
- **security**: Confirms secure coding practices

### Constitutional Compliance
- **architect**: Validates architectural compliance
- **developer**: Follows constitutional development practices
- **tester**: Validates constitutional testing requirements
- **security**: Ensures security constitutional requirements
- **reviewer**: Final constitutional compliance validation

### Documentation Standards
- **architect**: Creates architectural documentation
- **developer**: Documents APIs and implementation details
- **tester**: Documents testing strategies and coverage
- **security**: Documents security considerations and threats

## Agent Response Coordination

Each agent must:
1. **Validate Constitutional Compliance**: Check requirements against framework
2. **Collaborate Effectively**: Coordinate with other agents appropriately
3. **Maintain Quality Standards**: Enforce constitutional quality gates
4. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural and implementation decisions
5. **Continuous Validation**: Ensure ongoing constitutional compliance
