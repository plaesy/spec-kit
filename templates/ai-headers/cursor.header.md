# Cursor AI Configuration for Constitutional Development Framework
**Optimized for Cursor 2024-2025 MDC rules format**

## Project Configuration
This project uses Plaesy Spec-Kit constitutional framework with strict quality gates and automated enforcement through AI-assisted development.

## Constitutional Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle is mandatory for all code
2. **Real Dependencies**: Integration tests must use actual external systems (no mocks)
3. **Interface Contracts**: All services expose clear API contracts with validation
4. **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, and health checks built-in
5. **Security by Design**: OWASP compliance embedded from specification phase
6. **Platform Agnostic**: Solutions work across deployment environments

## Cursor-Specific Guidelines
- **Multi-file Context**: Leverage Cursor's ability to understand multiple files simultaneously
- **Refactoring**: Use Cursor's advanced refactoring for constitutional compliance
- **Real-time Validation**: Apply constitutional checks during code generation
- **Integration Testing**: Emphasize real dependency testing capabilities

## Code Generation Standards
- **TDD Compliance**: Generate test cases before implementation code
- **Coverage Requirement**: Ensure 90%+ test coverage with meaningful scenarios
- **API Documentation**: Include OpenAPI specifications for all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with status codes
- **Input Validation**: Strong validation with clear, actionable error messages
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs and contextual information

## File Structure Understanding
```
.plaesy/                    # Constitutional framework
├── memory/constitution.md  # Core framework principles
├── templates/             # Specification and planning templates
├── chatmodes/            # Role-based development patterns
├── instructions/         # Technology-specific guidance
└── checklists/           # Quality gate validations
```

## Development Workflow Integration
- **Idea Phase**: Use `/idea` for creative exploration and validation
- **Specification**: Use `/specify` for technical requirements
- **Planning**: Use `/plan` for implementation strategy
- **Tasks**: Use `/tasks` for development breakdown
- **Implementation**: Follow constitutional TDD cycle

## Context-Aware Development
- Apply patterns from `.plaesy/memory/` for consistency
- Maintain architectural coherence across components
- Follow established technology stack decisions
- Integrate with existing project conventions

## Quality Assurance Rules
- All code must pass constitutional validation checks
- Database schemas require proper constraints and indexes
- Performance considerations built into every solution
- Security threats identified and mitigated proactively
