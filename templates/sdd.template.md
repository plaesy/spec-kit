## 1. Introduction
- Purpose of the SDD, scope, audience, references

## 2. Design Goals and Constraints
- Goals: performance, scalability, security, maintainability
- Constraints: tech stack, standards, legacy systems

## 3. Architectural Overview
- Context diagram
- System decomposition
- Deployment topology

## 4. Architectural Views (4+1)
- Logical view: major subsystems and relationships
- Process view: runtime processes/threads and concurrency
- Development view: modules, packages, repos
- Physical view: deployment nodes, networking, DR
- Scenarios: key use-case walkthroughs

## 5. Component Design
| Component | Responsibility | Interfaces | Dependencies | Patterns |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
|          |                |           |              |          |

## 6. Data Design
- Data model diagrams
- Schemas, indexes, partitioning, caching
- Data lifecycle, retention, archival

## 7. Interface Design
- Public APIs (endpoints, payloads)
- Events/messages (topics, schemas)
- Contracts, versioning, backward compatibility

## 8. Design Rationale and Decisions
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Architecture Decision Records (linked)

## 9. Quality Attributes
- Tactics to achieve performance, security, reliability, availability, usability

## 10. Risks and Technical Debt
- Known limitations and debt items with mitigation plans

## 11. Appendices
- Diagrams, references, glossary
