# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Security-first mindset**: Consider authentication, authorization, input validation for every feature
5. **Performance considerations**: Think about scale, response times, resource usage
6. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions (roles, access levels)
   - Data retention/deletion policies (GDPR compliance)
   - Performance targets and scale (concurrent users, data volume)
   - Error handling behaviors (user experience, system recovery)
   - Integration requirements (external APIs, services)
   - Security requirements (authentication methods, data protection)
   - Monitoring and observability needs (logging, metrics, alerts)
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements _(mandatory)_

- **NFR-001**: Performance - [specific target, e.g., "API responses < 200ms p95"]
- **NFR-002**: Security - [specific requirement, e.g., "HTTPS required, input validation"]
- **NFR-003**: Scalability - [specific target, e.g., "support 1000 concurrent users"]
- **NFR-004**: Availability - [specific target, e.g., "99.9% uptime SLA"]
- **NFR-005**: Monitoring - [specific requirement, e.g., "structured logging for all user actions"]

### Security Requirements _(mandatory for user-facing features)_

- **SEC-001**: Authentication - [method and requirements]
- **SEC-002**: Authorization - [access control model]
- **SEC-003**: Data Protection - [encryption, privacy requirements]
- **SEC-004**: Input Validation - [sanitization, limits]
- **SEC-005**: Audit Logging - [security event tracking]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
