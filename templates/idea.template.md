   → If empty: ERROR "No idea description provided"
3. Extract core problem/opportunity using creative techniques
   → What problem does this solve?
   → Who benefits from this?
4. Apply structured brainstorming for solution approaches
   → Use What If, Analogical Thinking, SCAMPER, etc.
   → Generate 3-5 different solution approaches
5. Identify key stakeholders through role playing
   → Primary users, secondary users, system owners
6. Assess feasibility and impact with evidence
   → Technical complexity, resource requirements, business value
7. Define success criteria and metrics
