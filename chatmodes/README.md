## üîß Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

#### Q: Chat mode is not giving expected responses
**A**: Make sure you:
- Use correct syntax: `@[chatmode] [request]`
- Provide sufficient context in your request
- Choose the appropriate chat mode for your task type
- Verify the mode has the required tools available

#### Q: How to choose the right chat mode?
**A**: Use this guide:
- **Problem Definition**: `@bo` for business issues, `@ba` for requirements analysis
- **Planning**: `@pm` for product strategy, `@sa` for technical architecture
- **Implementation**: `@dev` for coding, `@qa` for testing
- **Deployment**: `@devops` for infrastructure, `@security` for security
- **Documentation**: `@dw` for all types of documentation

#### Q: Can I use multiple chat modes simultaneously?
**A**: Yes, use sequential workflow across different platforms:
```bash
# Cross-platform workflow
IDE: @sa Design microservices architecture
Web: dev | Implement user service
API: {"mode": "qa", "request": "Create integration tests"}
Slack: /plaesy devops Set up container deployment
```

#### Q: How do I access chatmodes from different platforms?
**A**: Choose the interface that fits your workflow:
- **Development**: Use IDE extensions (@chatmode syntax)
- **Communication**: Use Slack/Teams bots (/plaesy chatmode)
- **Web Work**: Use dashboard interface (mode | request)
- **Automation**: Use API integration (JSON requests)
- **Mobile**: Use mobile apps with voice/text input

#### Q: Chat mode is not following constitutional framework
**A**: Ensure:
- The mode has access to `/memory/constitution.md`
- You explicitly mention framework compliance requirements
- Use appropriate validation checklists
- Implement TDD and library-first approach

#### Q: How to customize chat mode for organization?
**A**: 
1. Fork existing chatmode file
2. Modify `tools` array as needed
3. Adjust `Persona Behavior` to match organizational culture
4. Add specific `Key Capabilities`
5. Update this README with the new mode

### Performance Optimization

#### Slow Response Times
- **Reduce Context**: Provide more specific requests
- **Single Focus**: Use one chat mode per task
- **Progressive Detail**: Start with high-level, then add details
- **Tool Selection**: Ensure mode has relevant tools

#### Inconsistent Quality
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear context and expectations
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Always reference framework principles
- **Quality Gates**: Use validation checklists
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use feedback loops for improvement

### Integration Issues

#### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```bash
# Embed chat mode validation in pipeline
/qa Generate automated test suite
/security Perform security assessment
/devops Create deployment configuration
```

#### Documentation Workflow
```bash
# Ensure comprehensive documentation
/dw Create API documentation
/sa Document architectural decisions
/dev Add inline code documentation
/pm Update product documentation
```
