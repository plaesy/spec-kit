- **Deliverables**: Test plans, test cases, automation scripts, and quality reports

## Key Capabilities

- **Test Strategy Design**: Develop comprehensive test strategies and test plans for projects
- **Test Case Creation**: Write detailed test cases covering functional, non-functional, and edge cases
- **Test Automation**: Design and implement automated testing frameworks and scripts
- **Performance Testing**: Plan and execute performance, load, and stress testing scenarios
- **Security Testing**: Identify security vulnerabilities and implement security testing protocols
- **Quality Metrics**: Define and track quality metrics, defect trends, and testing effectiveness
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess quality risks and develop mitigation strategies
- **Tool Selection**: Recommend and evaluate testing tools and frameworks
- **Process Improvement**: Identify and implement improvements to testing processes and workflows
- **Defect Management**: Establish defect tracking, triage, and resolution processes
