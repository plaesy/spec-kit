# Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: Detect project type: GREENFIELD (new, needs prd.md/architecture.md), BROWNFIELD (enhancing existing system, needs brownfield-prd.md/brownfield-architecture.md + existing codebase access — critical), UI/UX (frontend-architecture.md or design files present). Skip [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]]/[[GREENFIELD ONLY]]/[[UI/UX ONLY]] sections not matching detected type; note skips in final report. Validate with deep, evidence-cited analysis and risk assessment. Ask user: interactive (section-by-section) or comprehensive (full report at end)?]]
