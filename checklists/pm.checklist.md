# Product Manager (PM) Requirements Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework to ensure the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Epic definitions are complete, well-structured, and appropriately scoped for MVP development. The PM should systematically work through each item during the product definition process.

[[LLM: Need prd.md (docs/prd.md), research/market/competitive docs, business goals, existing epics/stories — ask for missing PRD. Validate: user-centric, minimal-but-viable MVP scope, clear/testable requirements, full coverage, technical feasibility. Ask user: section-by-section or full comprehensive-report mode.]]

## PRD & EPIC VALIDATION SUMMARY

[[LLM: Generate a report with: (1) Executive Summary — PRD completeness %, MVP scope fit (Too Large/Just Right/Too Small), architecture-phase readiness (Ready/Nearly Ready/Not Ready), critical gaps; (2) Category Analysis Table — Status PASS(90%+)/PARTIAL(60-89%)/FAIL(<60%) with critical issues; (3) Top Issues by Priority — BLOCKERS/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW; (4) MVP Scope Assessment — cuttable features, missing essentials, complexity, timeline realism; (5) Technical Readiness — constraint clarity, risks, areas needing architect investigation; (6) Recommendations — actions per blocker, improvements, next steps. Then offer: detailed analysis of failed sections, area-specific suggestions, or MVP scope refinement help.]]
