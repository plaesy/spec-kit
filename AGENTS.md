# Plaesy Spec-Kit Constitutional Framework

## Overview
This repository uses the **Plaesy Spec-Kit Constitutional Framework** - a chat-based methodology optimized for IDE native chat interfaces. Transform ideas into structured solutions through AI-guided workflows directly in your IDE chat. Use simple commands like `/idea`, `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` to create high-quality deliverables with constitutional compliance.

**âœ¨ Optimized for**: GitHub Copilot Chat, Qoder IDE, Cursor, Claude Code, and other IDE chat interfaces

## Environment Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Shell**: Bash (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows)
- **Permissions**: Read/write access to project directory
- **Network**: Internet access for initial setup (optional)

## Setup & Installation

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
/bin/bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plaesy/spec-kit/main/scripts/bash/install.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plaesy/spec-kit/main/scripts/powershell/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# Initialize constitutional framework in your project
plaesy init .
```

## Dependencies
- **Required**: None - framework is completely self-contained
- **Optional**: Git (for version control integration)
- **Usage**: Just start chatting with `/idea`, `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` commands

## Methodology & Constitutional Requirements

### Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Structured Thinking**: Follow constitutional reasoning patterns and frameworks
- **Quality-First**: Excellence and thoroughness in analysis and execution
- **Evidence-Based**: Decisions based on validated data and constitutional compliance
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive documentation with clear reasoning
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through constitutional validation

### Chat-Based Workflow
1. **Start with an idea**: Chat `/idea I want to create an app like Google Photos`
2. **Create specification**: Chat `/specify` to transform idea into detailed requirements
3. **Plan implementation**: Chat `/plan` to create structured approach and architecture
4. **Break down tasks**: Chat `/tasks` to get actionable implementation steps
5. **Use expert roles**: Chat with `@dev`, `@qa`, `@architect` for specialized guidance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Issue**: Framework not initializing properly
```bash
# Solution: Check permissions and run validation
chmod +x .plaesy/scripts/bash/*.sh
```

**Issue**: Templates not loading
```bash
# Solution: Verify file structure and permissions
ls -la .plaesy/templates/
find .plaesy -name "*.template.md" | wc -l  # Should show 40+ templates
```

**Issue**: AI assistant not following constitutional guidelines
```bash
# Solution: Ensure constitutional context is loaded first
cat .plaesy/memory/constitution.md
cat .plaesy/instructions/plaesy.instructions.md
```

### FAQ
**Q**: Can I customize the constitutional framework?
**A**: Yes, but maintain core principles. Modify templates and add domain-specific instructions.

**Q**: Does this work with all AI assistants?
**A**: Yes, framework generates platform-specific configurations automatically.

**Q**: How do I add new expert roles?
**A**: Create new `.chatmode.md` files following the established format and constitutional principles.
