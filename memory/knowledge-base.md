# üß† Context-Aware Knowledge Index

**Plaesy Spec-Kit** - AI-powered constitutional framework with **intelligent context detection** that automatically loads relevant knowledge based on your current project, technology stack, and development phase.

## üéØ **Smart Context Detection System**

### **Auto-Loading Patterns**
