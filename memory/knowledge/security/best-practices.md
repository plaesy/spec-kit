# Security Best Practices

Comprehensive security framework covering application, infrastructure, data, and operational security across all scales and environments.

## Modern Authentication & Authorization (2025 Edition)

### Authentication Patterns

- **Hardware Security Keys**: YubiKey, Google Titan, Microsoft Authenticator

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **TOTP (Time-based OTP)**: Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator
- **SMS Backup**: Secondary option, not primary due to SIM swapping risks
- **Hardware Tokens**: FIDO2/WebAuthn compliant devices
- **Backup Codes**: Single-use recovery codes for emergency access
- **Adaptive MFA**: Risk-based authentication requiring MFA for suspicious activities

#### Zero Trust Identity

### Authorization Frameworks

#### Fine-grained Access Control
```typescript
// Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
interface AccessPolicy {
  subject: UserAttributes;     // Who is requesting access
  resource: ResourceAttributes; // What is being accessed
  action: string;             // What operation is being performed
  environment: ContextAttributes; // When and where the access occurs
}

// Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)
interface ResourceRelationship {
  user: string;
  relation: 'owner' | 'editor' | 'viewer' | 'admin';
  resource: string;
  resourceType: 'document' | 'folder' | 'workspace';
}
```

#### Policy-as-Code Implementation
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**: Declarative policy language (Rego)
- **AWS IAM Policies**: JSON-based access control policies
- **Google Cloud IAM**: Role-based access control with conditions
- **Azure RBAC**: Role-based access control with custom roles
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Native Kubernetes role-based access control

#### Authorization Patterns
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: User roles with assigned permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Fine-grained attribute evaluation
- **Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)**: Graph-based permission modeling
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access**: Temporary elevated permissions with approval workflow
- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)**: Network-level access control based on identity

### Implementation Best Practices

#### JWT Token Management
```typescript
interface AuthTokens {
  accessToken: string;    // Short-lived (15 minutes)
  refreshToken: string;   // Long-lived (7 days), single use
  idToken?: string;       // User profile information (OIDC)
}

interface SecurityContext {
  userId: string;
  deviceId: string;
  location: GeoLocation;
  riskScore: number;      // 0-100, higher = more risky
  requiredMFA: boolean;
  sessionExpiry: Date;
}
```

#### Session Management
