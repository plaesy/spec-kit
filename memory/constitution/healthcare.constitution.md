# Healthcare & Life Sciences Constitutional Framework

## 🏥 **Core Healthcare Principles**

### **1. Patient Privacy & Data Protection (HIPAA Compliance)**
- **PHI Safeguarding**: All Protected Health Information must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Minimum Necessary Rule**: Access only the minimum data necessary for specific tasks
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access and modifications
- **Data Breach Response**: Immediate notification protocols within 60 days
- **User Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for all healthcare systems

### **2. Clinical Safety & Efficacy**
- **Clinical Validation**: All medical algorithms must undergo clinical validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous risk evaluation for patient safety
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Systems must enhance, not disrupt clinical workflows
- **Evidence-Based Design**: All features must be supported by clinical evidence
- **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when systems encounter errors

### **3. Regulatory Compliance Framework**
- **FDA Validation**: Medical device software must follow FDA guidelines
- **HL7 FHIR Standards**: Use standardized healthcare data exchange formats
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Transparent, explainable AI for clinical recommendations
- **Quality Management System**: ISO 13485 compliance for medical devices
- **Good Clinical Practice (GCP)**: Follow GCP guidelines for clinical trials
